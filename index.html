      <h1 id="">Who am I?</h1>

I am Yuri Gil Dantas, Brazilian, and old enough to hide my age. I am currently a research assistant at <a href="https://www.fortiss.org/en/">fortiss GmbH</a>, Munich, Germany. 


<h1 id="">Academic and research career so far</h1>

<p> I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science from Federal University of Paraiba, Brazil. Next, I moved to Germany to work as a research assistant at MAIS, TU Darmstadt. My research at MAIS focused on the development of runtime monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to mitigate cybersecurity attacks. I am currently a research assistant at fortiss GmbH, Munich, Germany. My current research at fortiss focuses on the development of techniques to integrate and automate safety and security methods. </p>
